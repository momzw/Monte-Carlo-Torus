    "Now, let's look at another feature of SERPENS: The scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the scheduler you are able to set up multiple simulations at once. These will get saved in separate folders. For each simulation the saved files are the parameters, a hash library and an archive bin-file. In order to analyze these, you need to move these files into the main folder of SERPENS afterwards. Note, however, that you need to analyze the simulations separately.\n",

    "The stars, planets and moons are set up in the _objects.py_ file. One needs to have the different systems and their celestial objects pre-defined. These celestial sets are indexed with the _celest_set_ attribute.\n",
    "In addition to the system, we can define a list of species to check (here it's only sodium) with their respective parameters (see further down below).\n",
    "If we want to change some parameters of the celestial objects, e.g. mass and radius, we can do so with the _objects_ argument. This argument must be given as a dictionary with the celestial bodies and their new parameters as a sub-dictionary. Valid arguments inside the sub-dictionary are REBOUND particle parameters and the argument _source_. Latter is a boolean that allows the user to set a different object as the simulation particle source. The original intention of this argument was to switch between sources if multiple natural satellites have been defined.\n",
    "\n",

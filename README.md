_Simulating Ring Particles Emergent from Natural Satellites_ <br>
This project was developed as a 3D weighted test-particle Monte-Carlo simulation of evaporating exomoons and their signatures in exoplanetary spectra. 

## Installation
For now, download and copy the repository to your project. A cleaner way of installing is one of the first items on our roadmap. 
A _requirements.txt_ lists all dependencies with their version number.

## Wiki
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/momzw/SERPENS/wiki) for more information on how to work with SERPENS.

# SERPENS
_Simulating Ring Particles Emergent from Natural Satellites_ <br>
This project was developed as a 3D weighted test-particle Monte-Carlo simulation of evaporating exomoons and their signatures in exoplanetary spectra. 

## Installation
For now, download and copy the repository to your project. A cleaner way of installing is one of the first items on our roadmap.
